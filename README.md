# Particle Life
## By David Vance

### My own implementation of Particle Life, in Python, inspired by many others.

This project is still a work in progress, and will change frequently.

### NOTE:
The code within main.js is entirely copied from the YouTube video "The code behind Particle Life" by Toh Mohr.
I copied that code first just to see how it works, before implementing my own version in Python.
I claim no ownership of the javascript code. See these links instead:
