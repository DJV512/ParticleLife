# Particle Life
## By David Vance

### My own implementation of Particle Life, in Python, inspired by many others.

This project was initially implemented in one file (main.py, now located within Original). I then challenged myself to 
refactor the code to make particles into a class, which has successfully been completed. Future goals include
adding in some kind of particle reproduction and death (i.e. evolution), and different particle sizes. 
Also, I want to try and re-implement the entire project in Mojo to see if I can get it to run faster (and therefore have 
more particles on screen at once).

This project is still a work in progress, and will change frequently.

### NOTE:
The code within Javascript/main.js is entirely copied from the YouTube video "The code behind Particle Life" by Tom Mohr.
I copied that code first just to see how it works, before implementing my own version in Python.
I claim no ownership of the javascript code. See these links instead:
